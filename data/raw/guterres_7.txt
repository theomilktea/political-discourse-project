I send my warmest greetings as you gather for this important progress review.


Since the Global Refugee Forum two years ago, we have seen more conflict, more displacement, more closed borders, and sharp cuts in humanitarian funding.


But the Global Compact on Refugees still points the way forward:


We must increase support for host countries – especially the low- and middle-income countries welcoming nearly three quarters of the world’s refugees.


We must boost refugee inclusion and self-reliance – a dignified way to unlock human potential, lift up local economies, and lower dependency on aid.


We must expand third-country solutions, like family reunification and resettlement, recognizing that for some refugees there simply are no local solutions.


And we must enable people to safely return home, as 1 million Syrians have done in the past 12 months.


I commend the 1,300 partners working to advance these aims – from governments and development banks to businesses, civil society, refugee-led organizations, and faith leaders.


I welcome the nearly 3,500 pledges they have made over the past seven years.


And I applaud the results they have delivered – like new labour laws that support refugee employment, more access to higher education for young refugees, and strengthened asylum processes in some countries.


Now I urge the world to do more – providing safety, opportunity, and solutions where they are needed most.


I am deeply grateful to Filippo Grandi, who has championed this vision while leading UNHCR during some of the biggest humanitarian crises in living memory.


As his mandate draws to a close, let us continue working together to invest in refugees and host communities.


And to defend and uphold the right to seek asylum and protection, a fundamental pillar of international law.


Thank you.
